# Hospitality Domain Dashboard Project

This project delivers business and data intelligence insights for **AtliQ Grands**, a luxury hotel chain operating multiple five-star hotels across India for over 20 years.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands has been facing challenges due to:

**•** Increasing competition from strategic moves by other hotel chains  
**•** Declining market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segments  
**•** Lack of an internal data analytics team to provide business insights  

To address these challenges, the Managing Director of AtliQ Grands decided to leverage **Business and Data Intelligence** to drive informed decision-making and regain market share. As a result, the revenue management team engaged a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and deliver actionable insights.

This project aims to build an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that provides key performance metrics and visual insights to support strategic business decisions.

## Project Goals

**•** Provide clear and actionable insights for revenue and occupancy performance  
**•** Enable better pricing strategies and competitive analysis  
**•** Help identify operational efficiencies and business opportunities  
**•** Facilitate data-driven decision-making for hotel management  

## Dashboard KPIs

The following KPIs were developed and displayed as cards on the Power BI dashboard:

### ADR (Average Daily Rate)

**Definition:** The ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. Measures the average amount paid per room sold in a given time period.

### RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)

**Definition:** Revenue generated per available room, whether occupied or not. Helps measure revenue performance and informs room pricing strategies.

### DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)

**Definition:** Indicates the average number of rooms available to sell each day over a specific period.

### Revenue

**Definition:** Total revenue realized from hotel operations.

### Occupancy %
